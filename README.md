### Getting Started
These instructions will provide you a guideline for our basic functions as well as how to running on your machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Description 
This repo aims at reproducing the results of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01417. Here is the abstract :
>High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance images (MRI) provide detailed anatomical information important for clinical application and> quantitative
image analysis. However, HR MRI conventionally comes at the cost of longer
scan time, smaller spatial coverage, and lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recent studies have shown that single image super-resolution (SISR), a technique
to recover HR details from one single low-resolution (LR) input image, could
provide high quality image details with the help of advanced deep convolutional
neural networks (CNN). However, deep neural networks consume memory heavily and run slowly, especially in 3D settings. In this paper, we propose a novel
3D neural network design, namely a multi-level densely connected super-resolution network (mDCSRN) with generative adversarial network >(GAN)â€“guided
training. The mDCSRN trains and inferences quickly, and the GAN promotes
realistic output hardly distinguishable from original HR images. Our results from
experiments on a dataset with 1,113 subjects shows that our new architecture
outperforms other popular deep learning methods in recovering 4x resolutiondowngraded images and runs 6x faster.

#### Prerequisites
To install the necessary packages, run the following command :

<code> pip install nibabel numpy pickle-mixin pandas matplotlib torch torchvision</code>
